  <h2>What is Bouldering?</h2>
  <p>
    Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls without
    the use of ropes or harnesses.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unlike traditional climbing, bouldering focuses on short but intensive routes called "problems," typically keeping
    climbers within a safe distance from the ground while they navigate challenging sequences of moves.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Bouldering?</h2>
  <p>
    Whether you're a complete beginner or an experienced athlete, climbers of all ages can challenge themselves,
