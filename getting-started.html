      <p>
        Unlike many outdoor sports, getting started with <a href="index.html">bouldering is surprisingly simple</a>.
        All you need are some climbing shoes, chalk, and a positive attitudeâ€”most gyms even rent the equipment for your
        first sessions. No prior experience or complex gear required!
