            <h2>What is Bouldering?</h2>
            <p>
              Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls
              without the use of ropes or harnesses.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_climbing">traditional climbing</a>,
              bouldering focuses on short but intensive routes called "problems," typically keeping climbers within a safe
              distance from the ground while they navigate challenging sequences of moves.

            Experience the perfect blend of <strong>physical challenge and mental puzzle-solving</strong> as you navigate
            routes close to the ground, with nothing but a crash pad and determination.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bouldering strips climbing down to its purest form, making it both <strong>to beginners and endlessly
            challenging for experts.</strong>
